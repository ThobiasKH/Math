\section{Introduction to Combinatorics}
Combinatorics is the branch of mathematics concerned with counting, arrangement, and structure of sets, particularly finite sets. The two main subfields of combinatorics are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Enumerative Combinatorics}: Counting the number of ways to arrange or select objects under various conditions.
    \item \textbf{Algebraic Combinatorics}: Applying algebraic techniques to combinatorial structures, often focusing on generating functions, group actions, and symmetric functions.
\end{itemize}

\section{Basic Counting Principles}
One of the fundamental problems in combinatorics is counting how many ways we can arrange or choose objects. Some basic counting principles include:

\subsection{The Addition Rule}
If we have two disjoint sets \( A \) and \( B \), the total number of elements in \( A \cup B \) is:
\[
|A \cup B| = |A| + |B|.
\]
This is known as the addition rule, and it generalizes to the union of any finite number of disjoint sets.

\subsection{The Multiplication Rule}
If we are selecting an element from set \( A \) and an element from set \( B \), and the choice of an element from \( A \) does not affect the choice from \( B \), the total number of possibilities is:
\[
|A \times B| = |A| \times |B|.
\]
This is known as the multiplication rule.

\section{Permutations and Combinations}
A permutation is an arrangement of objects in a specific order, while a combination is a selection of objects without regard to the order.

\subsection{Permutations}
The number of ways to arrange \( n \) objects in order is given by:
\[
P(n) = n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \cdots \times 1.
\]
If only \( r \) objects are selected from a set of \( n \) objects, the number of possible arrangements (permutations) is:
\[
P(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}.
\]

\subsection{Combinations}
The number of ways to choose \( r \) objects from a set of \( n \) objects, regardless of the order, is given by:
\[
C(n, r) = \binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}.
\]

\section{Introduction to Generating Functions}
Generating functions are a powerful tool in combinatorics that allow us to encode sequences of numbers into a formal power series.

\subsection{The Ordinary Generating Function (OGF)}
The ordinary generating function of a sequence \( \{a_n\} \) is defined as:
\[
A(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n.
\]
This function helps in solving recurrence relations and counting problems.

\subsection{The Exponential Generating Function (EGF)}
The exponential generating function for a sequence \( \{a_n\} \) is defined as:
\[
A(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{a_n x^n}{n!}.
\]
EGFs are particularly useful for counting labeled structures, like trees or graphs.

\section{Applications of Combinatorics}
In algebraic and enumerative combinatorics, one often works with specific problems like:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Counting the number of distinct objects under symmetries (e.g., counting distinct colorings or graphs).
    \item Solving recurrences using generating functions.
    \item Applying group theory to count invariant objects.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
The first week of an algebraic/enumerative combinatorics class typically introduces basic counting principles, combinatorial objects like permutations and combinations, and begins with the concept of generating functions. In the coming weeks, we will explore more advanced topics like recurrence relations, partitions, and applications of group theory in combinatorics.
