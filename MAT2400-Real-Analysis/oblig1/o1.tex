\begin{prob*}[1]
    Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space and $K \subseteq X$ a subset. 
    A function $f : K \to \mathbb R$ is \emph{lower semicontinuous}
    if for all $x \in K$ and $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists 
    $\delta > 0$ such that 
    \[
        y \in K, \: d(x,y) < \delta \Rightarrow f(x) < 
        f(y) + \varepsilon
    \]
    The goal of this problem is to show that if $f : K \to \mathbb R$
    is lower semicontinuous and $K$ is compact, then $f$ attains a 
    minimum, i.e. there is some $\overline x\in K$ such that 
    \[
        f(\overline x) \leq f(x) \qquad \forall x \in K.
    \] 
    You may proceed as follows: 

    (a) Let $m := \inf\{f(x) : x \in K\}$. Argue that there exists 
    a \emph{minimizing sequence} for $f$, i.e. a sequence 
    $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb N}$ in $K$ such that $f(x_n) \to m$ as 
    $n \to \infty$.

    Assume from now that $K$ is compact. 

    (b) Show that there is a subsequence $(x_{n_k})_{k\in\mathbb N}$ 
    and some $\overline x \in K$ such that $x_{n_k}\to \overline x$ 
    as $k \to \infty$. 

    (c) Show that $m \leq f(\overline x) \leq m + \varepsilon$
    for any $\varepsilon > 0$, and conclude that $\overline x$ is 
    a minimum of $f$.
\end{prob*}
\begin{proof}[Proof of (a)]
    Let $f : K \to \mathbb R$ be some function and let 
    $m := \inf\{f(x) : x \in K\}$. 

    By the definition of the infimum we have that, for every 
    $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists $x \in K$ such that
    \[
        f(x) \leq m + \varepsilon
    \]
    In particular for $\varepsilon := \frac{1}{n}$ this must be the 
    case. Then, for $n \in \mathbb N$ there exists $x_n \in K$ such 
    that 
    \[
        f(x_n) \leq m + \frac{1}{n}
    \]
    but $m$ is a lower bound for all $f(x_n)$ hence 
    \[
        m \leq f(x_n) \leq m + \frac{1}{n}
    \]
    so 
    \[
        f(x_n) \underset{n \to \infty}{\to} m 
    \] 
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of (b)]
    $(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N} \in K$ as described in proof of (a). 
    Since $K$ is compact, $(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$ has a convergent 
    subsequence which converges to some point $\overline x \in K$.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of (c)]
    By definition of $m$ as the infimum of all values of $f$ we 
    can see that 
    \[
        m \leq f(\overline x)
    \]
    By the virtue of $f$ being lower semicontinuous we may also 
    conclude that for any $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $\delta > 0$
    such that 
    \[
        d(\overline x, y) < \delta \Rightarrow f(\overline x) < 
        f(y) + \varepsilon
    \]
    In particular, since $x_{n_k} \to \overline x$, we can choose 
    $k$ large enough so that $d(\overline x, x_{n_k}) < \delta$. 
    I.e. 
    \[
        d(\overline x, x_{n_k}) < \delta \Rightarrow f(\overline x) 
        < f(x_{n_k}) + \varepsilon
    \]
    As $k \to \infty$ we know that $f(x_{n_k}) \to m$ so taking 
    the limit we get 
    \[
        m \leq f(\overline x) \leq m + \varepsilon
    \]
    Taking $\varepsilon \to 0$ we conclude that 
    \[
        m \leq f(\overline x) \leq m
    \]
    so $\overline x$ is a minimum of $f$.
\end{proof}

\begin{prob*}[2]
    Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space and $E \subseteq X$ any subset. 
    Let $f : E \to \mathbb R$ be any bounded function (i.e. 
    there is some $M \in \mathbb R$ such that $|f(x)| \leq M$ for 
    all $x \in E$). Define $g : \overline E \to \mathbb R$ by 
    \[
        g(x) := \underset{\underset{y \in E}{y \to x}}{\lim \inf} f(y)
        \qquad \forall x \in \overline E,
    \]
    that is, 
    \[
        g(x) := \lim_{n\to\infty}f_n(x), \qquad \text{where} \ 
        f_n(x) := \inf\{f(y) : y \in E \cap B(x;1/n)\}.
    \]
    (Here, $\overline E := E \cup \partial E$ is the closure of $E$.)
    The function $g$ is called the \emph{lower semicontinuous envelope}
    of $f$. 

    (a) Show that $g$ is well-defined, i.e. that the above limit 
    exists, and that 
    \[
        g(x) \leq f(x)
    \]
    for all $x \in E$. 

    (b) Show that $g$ is lower semicontinuous. 

    (c) Show that if $f$ is lower semicontinuous on $E$, then 
    $g(x) = f(x)$ for all $x \in E$.
\end{prob*}
\begin{proof}[Proof of (a)]
    Denote $\xi_{x,n} := E \cap B(x;1/n)$. It is easy to see that 
    $\xi_{x,n+1} \subseteq \xi_{x,n}$ (and that they are 
    nonempty for all $n\in\mathbb N$). Notice then that 
    \[
        f_n(x) \leq f_{n+1}(x) \leq f_{n+2}(x) \leq \cdots \leq M
    \]
    I.e. we get a monotone increasing sequence which is bounded 
    above, which converges. 

    It is quite clear that for $x \in E$ 
    \[
        \lim_{n\to\infty}f_n(x) \leq f(x)
    \]
    as for every $n$ $x \in B(x;\frac{1}{n})$ because 
    $d(x,x) = 0 < 1/n$ and by the definition of the infimum 
    $f_n(x) = \inf\{f(y) : y \in \xi_{x,n}\}$ is a lower bound for 
    the value of every specific $x \in \xi_{x,n}$. 
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of (b)]
    We wish to show that for every $x \in \overline E$ and 
    $\varepsilon > 0$ we can find 
    $\delta > 0$ such that 
    \[
        z \in \overline E, \; d(x,z) < \delta \Rightarrow 
        g(x) < g(z) + \varepsilon
    \]
    Let $x \in \overline E$ and $\varepsilon > 0$. Since 
    $g(x) = \lim_{n\to\infty}f_n(x)$ and the sequence of $f_n(x)$ is 
    non-decreasing, we have $f_n(x) \leq g(x)$ for all 
    $n \in \mathbb N$. Thus there exists $N \in \mathbb N$ such that 
    \[
        g(x) < f_N(x) + \varepsilon
    \]
    Recall that $f_N(x) = \inf\{f(y) : y \in E \cap B(x;1/N)\}$. 
    Choose $\delta > 0$ such that $B(z;\delta) \subseteq B(x;1/N)$. 
    For any $M > 1/\delta$ we have $B(z;1/M) \subseteq B(z;\delta) 
    \subseteq B(x;1/N)$. As we said in (a), the infimum over a larger
    set is less than or equal to the infimum over a subset. 
    Therefore 
    \[
        f_N(x) \leq f_M(z)
    \]
    As $m \to \infty$ we get 
    \[
        f_N(x) \leq g(z)
    \]
    Recalling that 
    \[
        g(x) < f_N(x) + \varepsilon
    \]
    we finally conclude that 
    \[
        g(x) < g(z) + \varepsilon
    \]
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of (c)]
    Let $x \in E \subseteq \overline E$. If $f$ is lower 
    semicontinuous then $\forall \varepsilon > 0, \ \exists \delta 
    > 0$ s.t. 
    \[
        z \in E, \: d(x,z) < \delta \Rightarrow f(x) < f(y) +  
        \varepsilon \Rightarrow f(x) \leq f(y) + \varepsilon
    \]
    In particular this holds for every $z \in E \cap B(x;1/N)$ (assume 
    $N \geq 1/\delta$), so it holds for the infimum as well, i.e. 
    \[
        d(x,z) < \delta \Rightarrow f(x) \leq f_n(x) + \varepsilon, \: 
        n \geq N
    \]
    Once again, nondecreasing sequence so take the limit to get 
    \[
        f(x) \leq g(x) + \varepsilon
    \]
    Together with the results from (a) and (b) we conclude the 
    desired result. 
\end{proof}
