\section{Introduction}

\begin{defn}[Sets]
\label{def:sets}
A \emph{set} is a collection of distinct elements.
\end{defn}

As discussed in \cref{def:sets}, elements must be distinct.

\begin{thm}[Sum of evens]\label{thm:sum}
The sum of two even numbers is even.
\begin{proof}
Let the even numbers be \(2a\) and \(2b\). Their sum is
\[
2a + 2b = 2(a+b),
\]
which is even.
\end{proof}
\end{thm}

As described in \cref{thm:sum}. 

\begin{lem}[Parity of sum]\label{lem:parity}
If \(x\) and \(y\) are integers, then \(x + y\) is even if and only if \(x\) and \(y\) have the same parity.
\end{lem}

As seen in \cref{lem:parity}, you are a very nice person.

\begin{proof}
Assume \(x\) and \(y\) are both even or both odd.

- If both even, \(x=2m\), \(y=2n\), then \(x+y=2(m+n)\) is even.

- If both odd, \(x=2m+1\), \(y=2n+1\), then
\[
x+y = 2m + 1 + 2n + 1 = 2(m+n+1),
\]
also even.

Conversely, if \(x+y\) is even and \(x\) is even, then \(y\) must be even; similarly for odd.
\end{proof}

\section{Model Theory}

\begin{prob}[Satisfiability]
Let \(\mathfrak{M} \models \phi\). Show that \(\phi\) is satisfiable.
\end{prob}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Problem 2.1]
Since \(\mathfrak{M} \models \phi\), by definition \(\phi\) is true in some model (namely \(\mathfrak{M}\)). Therefore, \(\phi\) is satisfiable.

More explicitly,
\[
\phi = \psi \wedge \theta,
\]
where \(\psi\) and \(\theta\) are formulas satisfied by \(\mathfrak{M}\). Hence \(\phi\) is satisfiable.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}[Consequence of satisfiability]
If \(\phi\) is satisfiable, then \(\neg \phi\) is not valid.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
If \(\neg \phi\) were valid, then \(\phi\) would be false in every model. This contradicts the satisfiability of \(\phi\).
\end{proof}

\section{Fourier Analysis}

\begin{defn}[Fourier Transform]
The Fourier transform of a function \(f \in L^1(\mathbb{R})\) is defined as
\[
\hat{f}(\xi) = \int_{\mathbb{R}} f(x) e^{-2\pi i x \xi} \, dx.
\]
\end{defn}

\begin{thm}[Fourier Inversion]
If \(f\) and \(\hat{f}\) are both in \(L^1(\mathbb{R})\), then for almost every \(x\),
\[
f(x) = \int_{\mathbb{R}} \hat{f}(\xi) e^{2\pi i x \xi} \, d\xi.
\]
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}[Sketch of proof]
This theorem follows from Plancherel's theorem and properties of the Fourier transform on Schwartz functions. The full proof is beyond this note.
\end{proof}
