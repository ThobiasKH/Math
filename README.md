# Math & Theoretical Computer Science

Math/TCS is one of my biggest interests and this is a collection of lecture notes, assignments and more.
Since TCS is so mathematically deep, lecture notes in subjects in that area are here as well. 

Currently at my enrolled degree, Mat104 (Introduction to Mathematics for Information Technology) is the only math course I am taking (we also had Discrete Math 1 in semester 1), and the other subjects in the repo are self-taught using books and online lectures because I find them fun and interesting. I do plan on taking them formally at a later time and hope to be well prepared. 
In addition to Mat104 there is Dat102 Algorithms and Data structures which has a bit of TCS concepts in it.
