# Math

Math is one of my biggest interests and this is a collection of lecture notes, assignments and more.

Currently at my enrolled degree, Mat104 (Introduction to Mathematics for Information Technology) is the only math course I am taking (we also had Discrete Math 1 in semester 1), and the other subjects in the repo are self-taught using books and online lectures because I find them fun and interesting. I do plan on taking them formally at a later time and hope to be well prepared.
