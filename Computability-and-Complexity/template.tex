\section{Introduction}
The following will be my notes for computability and complexity, which
I shall hopefully be taking at the University of Oslo during 
the spring of 2026 (Course-code: IN2080). If this document 
is renamed to IN2080 - Computability and Complexity, then I 
was allowed to take the course. 
Like with the rest of my electives at UiO, I have to learn 
everything by myself which will undoubtedly manifest 
in my notes being a bit scattered at times. 
If you are someone who stumbled over these notes keep this in mind. 

Furthermore I have dabbled in some automata theory earlier so while 
these notes will be heavily Sipser-flavoured, I will not go 
very into detail on DFA's.

\section{Nondeterministic Finite Automata}
\begin{defn}
    \label{defn:nfa}
    A nondeterministic finite automaton $N$ is a $5$-tuple 
    $$ 
        (Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_0, F),
    $$
    the same as a DFA, except: 
    \begin{align*}
        \delta : Q \times \Sigma_\varepsilon \to \mathcal P(A) 
        &= \{R : R \subseteq Q\}, \\
        \Sigma_\varepsilon &= \Sigma \cup \{\varepsilon\} \text{ and}\\
        \mathcal P(Q) &= \text{the powerset of } Q
    \end{align*}

    We say that an NFA $N$ accepts a string $w$ if at least one 
    computation path reads all of $w$ and ends in a state in $F$. 
\end{defn}

This is a bit difficult to grasp with the definition alone so we look 
at an example. 

\begin{ex}
    Consider an NFA over $\Sigma = \{a,b\}$ which accepts strings 
    ending in $ab$ constructed as follows: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item States: $Q = \{q_0, q_1, q_2\}$
        \item Start: $q_0$
        \item Accepting: $q_2$ 
    \end{itemize}
    with the $\delta$ defined such that 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $q_0 \overset{a}{\mapsto} q_0$
        \item $q_0 \overset{b}{\mapsto} q_0$
        \item $q_0 \overset{a}{\mapsto} q_1$
        \item $q_1 \overset{b}{\mapsto} q_2$
    \end{itemize}
    Take $w = aab$. From $q_0$ with the middle symbol 
    $a$ we got to $q_0$ or $q_1$. From $q_1$ we go to $q_2$ so there 
    is one branch where we end in an accept state so 
    $w$ gets accepted. 
\end{ex}

\newpage
\begin{thm}
    If an NFA recognizes a language $A$, then $A$ is regular. 
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    Let the NFA $N = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ recognize $A$, 
    construct the DFA $N' = (Q', \Sigma', \delta', q_0', F')$ with 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $Q' = \mathcal P(Q), R \in Q'$
        \item $\delta'(R,a) = \{q : q \in \delta(r,a), r \in R\}$
        \item $q_0' = \{q_0\}$
        \item $F' = \{R \in Q' : R \cap F \neq \emptyset\}$
    \end{itemize}
    At least one computation path in $N$ ends in an accept state. 
    We have all possible computations $R \in Q'$. At least one 
    $R$ accepts $w$ and $R \cap F'$ is nonempty so $N'$ accepts $w$.
\end{proof}
